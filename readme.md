# Online labs with ADI

Authors:  SFW and MWS

This is the online repository for the paper on online labs that we want to write for _The Physics Teacher_.

## TPT pages and resources

- [TPT Author guideline page](https://www.aapt.org/publications/tptauthors.cfm)
- Paper length limitation:

> Papers published in The Physics Teacher are generally quite short compared to those appearing in many other journals. Manuscripts should normally not exceed 2000 words. Occasionally, a longer manuscript of up to 4000 words (3000 words with pictures and diagrams) may be considered. However, the author must first submit a brief description and an outline for preliminary approval. These should be accompanied by a statement explaining why the material requiring the additional page space would be useful and interesting enough to readers to warrant publication.


## Questions/answers

- Does TPT have a LaTeX style guide? One is not specifically mentioned:

> Papers should be prepared in MS Word or other text processing software, but for the initial submission process we require that authors submit a single, self-contained PDF file which includes the complete manuscript, with figures, tables, and reference lists.

- Who do we contact?

> For more information on submitting to TPT, contact the Editorial Office at 828-262-7497; tpt@appstate.edu
