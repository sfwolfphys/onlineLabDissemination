{\Large Investigation: Measuring and characterizing human reaction time}\\
ECU Graduate TA Professional Development\\

\end{center}

\section*{Investigation Groups}
Everyone has been assigned to an investigation group of three or four people. Each group will interact in a breakout session where they will collaborate on the investigation. 

\subsection*{Breakout session instructions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Go to the Teams breakout channel with the same number as your group.
\item The group leader (first person listed in the group) should start the breakout session by pressing the \texttt{Meet} button on the upper right of the Teams window.
\item Everyone in the group should join the breakout meeting to collaborate on the investigation.
\item The session leader will make an announcement when it is time to return to the main session.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Guiding Question}
Do two people have the same reaction time?

\section*{Experiment}
Your task is to design and carry out a procedure to measure a person's reaction time using the online reaction timer at \href{https://nrich.maths.org/reactiontimer}{https://nrich.maths.org/reactiontimer} and compare two measured values accounting for uncertainties in order to answer the guiding question.

\section*{Argumentation}
Each group will prepare a three-slide PowerPoint (PPT) presentation with their argument.\footnote{%
Note that face-to-face labs use a whiteboard for the argumentation session instead of a PPT. The three-slide PPT presentation is used in online labs.
} 
The presentation slides should be:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Description of procedure.  What did you measure, and how did you measure it?
\item Results. This can include a graph, a table, or a result from your measurements.
\item Argument. Answer the guiding question. Use your results to justify your argument.
\end{enumerate}
Select a presenter from each group. The presenter will give the group's PowerPoint during the argumentation session. The other members of the group will be responsible for contributing to the discussion about the each groups' presentations.\footnote{%
Face-to-face labs conduct the argumentation session by rotating non-presenters through the room to interact with presenters from other groups while online labs use a PPT presentation to multiple groups.
