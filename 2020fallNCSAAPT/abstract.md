## Title: Transforming introductory physics labs (and doing them online) using Argument Driven Inquiry

At East Carolina University, we have been transforming our Introductory Lab Curriculum to privilege authentic science practices as a part of our XLABs (Cross-Disciplinary Lab Transformation) project (NSF-IUSE: #1725655) using the curricular format _Argument Driven Inquiry_ (ADI).  ADI is a curricular format which engages students in a vast range of scientific practices which include designing experiments, analyzing and interpreting data, and engaging in argument from evidence. Indeed, since the beginning of the altered instructional paradigm, we have been deploying this curriculum online using both synchronous and asynchronous activities.  Contrary to some scientific disciplines, introductory physics can easily be studied with a few simple tools.  In order to facilitate remote physics laboratory learning, we have constructed kits for our students to use during their laboratory experience.  This workshop will work you through an ADI cycle, demonstrating some of the activities used and rubrics used for evaluating student work.
