# Physics ADI Workshop
Author: Steven F. Wolf

## Title: Transforming introductory physics labs using Argument Driven Inquiry

At East Carolina University, we have been transforming our Introductory Lab Curriculum to privilege authentic science practices as a part of our XLABs (Cross-Disciplinary Lab Transformation) project (NSF-IUSE: #1725655) using the curricular format _Argument Driven Inquiry_ (ADI).  ADI is a curricular format which engages students in a vast range of scientific practices which include designing experiments, analyzing and interpreting data, and engaging in argument from evidence. This workshop will work you through an ADI cycle, demonstrating some of the activities used and rubrics used for evaluating student work.
