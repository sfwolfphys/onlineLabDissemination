Dear Dr. Wolf:

We have now received referee feedback on your manuscript, TPT20-AR-00752, entitled

"Introductory Physics Labs: A Tale of Two Transformations."

The report is overall favorable; however, the referee raises several points that merit your attention.

Please resubmit a new version of your paper (without author name(s) or affiliation, so that the paper may be reviewed anonymously) that includes changes you have made in response to the reviewers' comments. At this stage of the review process, it is helpful for your revision to be submitted as a Word document with separate figure files. In addition, please indicate in a response letter (also without author name(s) or affiliation) a summary of your reaction to the reviewers' comments that can be shared with the referees, and a list of subsequent changes that you have made to your manuscript. It is not necessary that you agree with the reviewers on every point, nor that you change your manuscript exactly as the reviewers suggest, rather that you address each point that the reviewers make, and indicate the extent to which the revised version of the manuscript aligns with the reviewers' comments.

Once you are ready to submit your revision, please go to the online submission form at https://tpt.peerx-press.org/cgi-bin/main.plex?el=A1Cz3HHCY2A3JmHG4I1A9ftdV8PHg9aFyYYIkQ6a46T7AY and enter the resubmission there.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions about my decision.

Thank you for giving us the opportunity to consider your work.

Sincerely,

Gary White

Manuscript #TPT20-AR-00752:



****************
Editor's Comments:
I note that near the end of your manuscript you say:

"Many students could not or did not attend the online WebEx sessions or participate with
their assigned groups. Once they left campus, many students found they had increased
work or school responsibilities (42.1 %) or additional family responsibilities (59.0 %).14 We removed non-participating students from groups and gave them an opportunity to make up their missed work asynchronously. Less than 50% of the students in the make-up groups completed their work."

Please consider elaborating a bit, indicating the variety of ways, and levels of success, that your department and campus attempted to accommodate their needs more expansively and to attend to the health and well-being of these students, as appropriate.
