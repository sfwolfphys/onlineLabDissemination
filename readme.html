<h1>Online labs with ADI</h1>

<p>Authors:  SFW and MWS</p>

<p>This is the online repository for the paper on online labs that we want to write for <em>The Physics Teacher</em>.</p>

<h2>TPT pages and resources</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.aapt.org/publications/tptauthors.cfm">TPT Author guideline page</a></li>
<li>Paper length limitation:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Papers published in The Physics Teacher are generally quite short compared to those appearing in many other journals. Manuscripts should normally not exceed 2000 words. Occasionally, a longer manuscript of up to 4000 words (3000 words with pictures and diagrams) may be considered. However, the author must first submit a brief description and an outline for preliminary approval. These should be accompanied by a statement explaining why the material requiring the additional page space would be useful and interesting enough to readers to warrant publication.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Questions/answers</h2>

<ul>
<li>Does TPT have a LaTeX style guide? One is not specifically mentioned:</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>Papers should be prepared in MS Word or other text processing software, but for the initial submission process we require that authors submit a single, self-contained PDF file which includes the complete manuscript, with figures, tables, and reference lists.</p>
